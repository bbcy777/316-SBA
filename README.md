# SBA 316: The Document Object Model
Build an online food ordering page 

- validate it's a name at Nav when submit
- Use bootstrap cards for menu lists
- Sidebar are for cart list with click evt listener

future update:
- I used template for the side div. It is not letting me add event listener.
- I am not sure how to insert the menu list on top of the submit button.
